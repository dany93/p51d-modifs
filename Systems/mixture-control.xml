<!--

Emulates the auto mixture controls of a Packard Merlin powered Mustang P-51B/C/D/K/H.  
Would probably work for other Merlin powered aircraft like the Spitfire and 
Mosquito as well.

Lever in Full Rich position will give full rich mixture 100% of the time.
This is used for stating the engine, take off and landing at lower altitudes  
and in case the auto mixture feature malfunctions.

With the lever at it's lowest position it will give a leaned mixture for 
cruising.  This will automatically control mixture but should only be used 
for reduced throttle cruising.  It will reduce fuel use by about 5% compared 
to the normal run position.  When the throttle is fully closed this 
position will also act as the fuel cutoff position for shutting down the 
engine on the ground.

In between will result in the normal run position which will automatically 
control mixture at all altitudes and power settings.
