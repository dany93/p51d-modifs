Feel free to amend it.

About 2003: P51D Creation by Jim Wilson, with a YASim FDM.

Around from 2010: Hal Van Engel improvements.
Implementation (in collaboration with Jon S. Berndt) of the JSBSim FDM.
During 2010 - 2014, Hal Van Engel made this aircraft one of the most wonderful, sophisticated in FlightGear:
- FDM, stall and spin behavior (pionneer work, up to flat spin).
- Systems
- 3D
..... ?

Viewed from the FlightGear community, this aircraft was his "kid".

Hal, we miss you very much...
